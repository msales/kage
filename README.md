## Synopsis

Kage (as in "Kafka AGEnt") reads Offset- and Lag metrics from Kafka and writes them to an InfluxDB.

## Motivation

When you're running Kafka you probably want to have monitoring as well.  
You can - of course - query the beans directly via JMX and work with that, but that requires another JVM that collects the data.  
If you're a java-shop anyway and have all that available - give it a try.
We decided that we wanted to get the metrics straight out of Kafka and feed them into InfluxDB in a configurable way - and here we are now.

## Basic Installation

Grab a binary from the Releases or clone the repo and build it yourself.  
Fill the provided [sample configuration](example.json) with appropriate configuration for your setup, copy both files 
to the host you want to run kage on and run
```
kage --config=example.json

```

## Advanced Installation

There's systemd configuration magic in examples/systemd/.  
Put the files in the appropriate directories on your machine (in case of Debian/Ubuntu that should be /lib/systemd/system 
and /lib/systemd/system-generators), remember to chmod 0755 the generator, create /etc/kage/, run ```systemctl daemon-reload``` 
and then you should get one service per configuration-file in /etc/kage/.

## Configuration

Kage can be configured with configuration files, command line flags and environment variables. 

Kage uses an inheritance model for configuration. The order of precedence is: command line flags, 
environment variables, configuration files.
 
#### Command Line Flags

| Flag | Options | Multiple Allowed | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| --config | | Yes | The path to the JSON configuration file.  |
| --log | stdout, file | No | The type of log to use. |
| --log-file | | No | The path to the file to log to. |
| --log-level | debug, info, warn, error | No | The log level to use. |
| --brokers | | Yes | The kafka seed brokers connect to. Format: 'ip:port'. |
| --ignore-topics | | Yes | The kafka topic patterns to ignore. This may contian wildcards. |
| --ignore-groups | | Yes | The kafka consumer group patterns to ignore. This may contian wildcards. |
| --reporters | influx, stdout | Yes | The reporters to use. |
| --influx | | No | The DSN of the InfluxDB server to report to. Format: http://user:pass@ip:port/database'. |
| --influx-metric | | No | The measurement name to report statistics under. |
| --influx-policy | | No | The retention policy to report statistics under. |
| --influx-tags | | Yes | Additional tags to add to the statistics. Format: 'key:value' |
| --addr | | No | The address to bind to for the http server. |

#### Environment Variables

Environment variable names can be derived from the command line flags, prefixing them with ```KAGE_```
and using uppercase changing - to _, e.g. ```--log-level``` becomes ```KAGE_LOG_LEVEL```.
Where multiple command line flags are allowed, environment variable values should be separated by a new line character.

## HTTP Endpoints

Kage has an optional http server that can be enabled with the ```--addr``` configuration. This allows health checking
as well as fetching broker and consumer group information. The endpoints are as follows:

#### GET /health

Gets the current health status ok Kage.
 
#### GET /topics

Get a topic offset information in json format.

#### GET /consumers

Get a consumer group offset information in json format.

#### GET /consumers/$group

Get a consumer group offset information for the specified consumer group in json format, or will return with a 404 status code.
